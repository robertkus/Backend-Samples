//DiceRolling.java -- The program simulates the rolling of two die, rolling the dice 36,000 times, calculating the sum
//	of each roll, and returns the results in a tabular format, showing the number of times a dice total was rolled.
//  The program uses a random number generator to create a pair of rolls between 1 and 6 and holds the number of times
//  a sum was calculated in a one-dimensional array, tallying up the sums between 2 and 12.
//CSIS 212-D01
//No external sources used.
