//CAIProgram.java -- This program generates two random numbers and the user enter a value that they think
//     is the product of the two numbers. The program then displays a message stating whether the response
//     is correct or not. If it is correct, the program generates another two numbers and asks for the product
//     of the numbers. If wrong, the program continues to ask for the product until the correct answer is entered.
