//SalaryCalculator.java -- This program calculates the pay of three employees based on each employee's hours worked and pay rate.
//   The program captures the hours worked and pay rates based on user inputs, and while loops are used to continuously prompt for
//   these entries if an entry less than 0 is entered. If...else blocks determine which calculation is used and what pay is displayed
//   for each employee based on the hours worked. If the employee works 40 hours or less, they are paid their normal rate for each
//   hour worked. If the employee works more than 40 hours, they are paid their normal rate for the first 40 hours and 1.5 times their
//   normal rate for every hour worked after.
//CSIS 212-D01
//No external sources used.
